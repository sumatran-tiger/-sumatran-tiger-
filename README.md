# Sumatran Tiger

The Sumatran tiger is [listed](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/pdf/5334836/attachment) as Critically Endangered by IUCN. Major threats include habitat loss, poaching and prey depletion. A 1978 census estimated the wild population at about 1,000. Since then, much of the favorable tiger habitat has been disrupted or destroyed by human activity. Consequently, the wild Sumatran tiger population is now estimated at around 400.
